## üìà Sprint Velocity Tracking

### Velocity Calculation Method

**Velocity = Total Story Points Completed √∑ Sprint Duration**

#### Historical Baseline (Estimated)

- **Estimated Team Velocity**: 35-42 story points per week
- **Sprint 1 Target**: 38 story points (foundation & integration)
- **Sprint 2 Target**: 42 story points (polish & production readiness)
- **Velocity Buffer**: 15% capacity reserved for unknown unknowns

#### Velocity Tracking Metrics

```
Sprint Burndown Formula:
- Day 0: Total committed points
- Daily: Remaining points = Total - Completed points
- Ideal burndown line: Linear decrease to zero
- Actual vs. ideal variance tracking
```

#### Velocity Factors & Adjustments

| Factor                         | Impact    | Mitigation                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Streamlit Learning Curve**   | -5 points | Pair programming, documentation      |
| **API Integration Complexity** | -3 points | Early prototyping, fallback plans    |
| **Team Coordination**          | +2 points | Strong communication protocols       |
| **Clear Requirements**         | +3 points | Detailed PRD and acceptance criteria |
