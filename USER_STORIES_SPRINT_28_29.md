### ‚ö° US-5.10: Performance Optimization & Caching

**Story Points:** 5 | **Priority:** Medium | **Theme:** Responsive & Performance

#### Story Description

**As a** user of TalkingPhoto  
**I want** fast, responsive application performance  
**So that** I can efficiently create videos without waiting for slow loading

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC-5.10.1: Page Load Optimization**

- [ ] Initial page load time < 2 seconds on standard broadband
- [ ] CSS and JavaScript bundled and minified
- [ ] Images optimized and properly sized
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented for non-critical content
- [ ] Critical rendering path optimized

**AC-5.10.2: Caching Strategy**

- [ ] Static assets cached with appropriate headers
- [ ] API responses cached where appropriate
- [ ] User preferences and settings cached locally
- [ ] Upload previews cached to avoid regeneration
- [ ] Component rendering optimized with Streamlit caching

**AC-5.10.3: Runtime Performance**

- [ ] Form interactions respond within 100ms
- [ ] File upload processing doesn't block UI
- [ ] Large lists and tables virtualized for performance
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for long sessions
- [ ] Battery usage optimized for mobile devices

**AC-5.10.4: Monitoring & Metrics**

- [ ] Performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] Core Web Vitals tracked (LCP, FID, CLS)
- [ ] User experience metrics collected
- [ ] Performance regressions detected automatically
- [ ] Optimization recommendations generated

#### Technical Implementation

```python
# Performance optimization utilities
import streamlit as st
from functools import lru_cache

@st.cache_data(ttl=3600)
def load_static_resources():
    """Cache static resources for 1 hour"""
    return {
        'voices': get_voice_options(),
        'languages': get_language_options(),
        'templates': get_text_templates()
    }

@st.cache_resource
def get_image_processor():
    """Cache resource-heavy objects"""
    return ImageProcessor()

class PerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}

    def track_page_load(self, start_time):
        load_time = time.time() - start_time
        self.metrics['page_load'] = load_time

        if load_time > 2.0:
            self.log_performance_issue("slow_page_load", load_time)

    def optimize_component_rendering(self):
        # Implement lazy loading for expensive components
        if 'heavy_component_loaded' not in st.session_state:
            if st.button("Load Advanced Features"):
                st.session_state.heavy_component_loaded = True
                st.rerun()
        else:
            self.render_heavy_component()
```

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] All performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Caching working correctly without stale data issues
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics collection implemented
- [ ] No performance regressions introduced
- [ ] Mobile performance optimized
- [ ] Memory leaks tested and resolved

#### Test Scenarios

1. **Load Time Test:** Page loads within 2 seconds on various network speeds
2. **Interaction Test:** All user interactions respond within 100ms
3. **Memory Test:** Extended usage doesn't cause memory leaks
4. **Cache Test:** Cached content serves correctly and updates when needed
5. **Mobile Performance Test:** Optimized performance on mobile devices
6. **Stress Test:** Application remains responsive under load
