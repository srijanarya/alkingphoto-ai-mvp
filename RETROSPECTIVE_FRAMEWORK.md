□ Set up virtual collaboration tools (Miro, breakout rooms)
□ Create safe space environment and psychological safety reminders
□ Prepare retrospective agenda and time management plan

Facilitation Supplies:
□ Timer for timeboxing activities
□ Sticky notes (physical or digital)
□ Markers for writing and grouping
□ Voting dots for prioritization
□ Flip chart paper for visual mapping
□ Camera for action item documentation
```

### Advanced Retrospective Techniques

#### Technique 1: Timeline Retrospective

**When to Use**: Complex sprints with many events and changes

```
Timeline Creation (20 minutes):
├── Draw sprint timeline on whiteboard/Miro
├── Add major events, milestones, decisions
├── Mark emotional highs and lows for team
├── Identify patterns and correlations between events

Analysis Questions:

├── What triggered our lowest points and how did we recover?
├── What patterns can we see in our team dynamics?
├── Which decisions had the biggest positive/negative impact?
```

#### Technique 2: Sailboat Retrospective

**When to Use**: When team needs to balance achievements with obstacles

```
Visual Metaphor Setup:
├── Sailboat = Our team moving toward sprint goal
├── Wind = Forces helping us move forward (strengths)
├── Anchors = Things slowing us down (impediments)
├── Rocks = Risks and obstacles ahead (future threats)

Discussion Focus:
├── How can we increase our "wind" (leverage strengths)?
├── How can we remove or reduce our "anchors" (eliminate waste)?
├── How can we navigate around "rocks" (mitigate risks)?
├── What would make our sailboat faster and more agile?
```

#### Technique 3: Lean Coffee Retrospective

**When to Use**: When team has many discussion topics and wants democratic prioritization

```
Topic Generation (5 minutes):
├── Everyone writes discussion topics on sticky notes
├── Topics should be specific issues or opportunities
├── One topic per sticky note, brief description

Prioritization (5 minutes):
├── Group similar topics together
├── Dot vote on topics to discuss (3 dots per person)
├── Arrange topics in priority order

Timeboxed Discussion (40 minutes):
├── Discuss highest priority topic for 5 minutes
├── Vote to continue (thumbs up) or move on (thumbs down)
├── Continue for 3 minutes more if voted to continue
├── Move to next topic and repeat
```

### Virtual Retrospective Best Practices

#### Technology Setup for Remote Teams

```
Required Tools:
□ Video conferencing with breakout room capability
□ Digital whiteboard (Miro, Mural, Jamboard)
□ Timer visible to all participants
□ Collaborative note-taking tool
□ Screen sharing capability for results presentation

Engagement Techniques:
├── Use breakout rooms for small group discussions
├── Employ digital voting and prioritization tools
├── Encourage use of chat for parallel thoughts
├── Use cameras on for better emotional connection
├── Take breaks every 30 minutes for longer sessions
```
