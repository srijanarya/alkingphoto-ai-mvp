## Design Notes

### Pattern Chosen

**Clean Architecture** with service-oriented design:

- **Routes Layer**: RESTful API endpoints with input validation
- **Service Layer**: Business logic isolation with external API integration
- **Model Layer**: Database entities with rich domain logic
- **Utilities Layer**: Cross-cutting concerns and security helpers

### Security Implementation

- **JWT Authentication**: 24-hour access tokens with refresh capability
- **Rate Limiting**: Flask-Limiter with configurable per-endpoint limits
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation with Marshmallow schemas
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- **File Security**: Virus scanning, MIME type validation, secure storage
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with breach detection
- **SQL Injection**: SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- **CORS**: Configurable origins with security headers

### Data Migrations

**5 Core Tables Created**:

1. `users` - GDPR-compliant user management with subscription tiers
2. `user_sessions` - JWT session tracking with device information
3. `uploaded_files` - File metadata with cloud storage integration
4. `video_generations` - AI processing workflow with cost tracking
5. `subscriptions` - Stripe billing integration with usage limits
6. `payment_transactions` - Complete payment audit trail
7. `usage_logs` - Comprehensive analytics and compliance tracking

### AI Service Architecture

**Multi-Provider Routing System**:

- **Primary**: Veo3 API for balanced cost/quality (₹0.15/second)
- **Economy**: Nano Banana for budget-conscious users (₹0.039/image)
- **Premium**: Runway for highest quality output (₹0.20/second)
- **Fallback**: Automatic provider switching on failures
- **Cost Optimization**: Real-time provider selection based on quality preference

### Cloud Storage Strategy

**Hybrid Storage Approach**:

- **Primary**: AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN for global delivery
